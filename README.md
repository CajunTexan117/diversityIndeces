# diversityIndeces
This repository contains a collection of Python functions that calculate diversity indices and create graphs to visualize them.
NOTE: This current version assumes that your data is formatted the following way: .csv spreadsheet files with species names as column headers and each row being a sampling site. If your first column is the number of your sampleing sites, THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK with that data; you will get incorrect diversity indice values and erroneous graphs. We will work our hardest to get this sorted in subsequent versions.
